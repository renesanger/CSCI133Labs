this lab was particularly difficult especially in regards to task number three in which i did not even know what it was asking. what did i have to have returned in the end? is it a boolean? or a void? along with that I also thought that task two was also har in its own way. I got stuck for a while on that one, moved on to question 3 and got stuck on that one also.
