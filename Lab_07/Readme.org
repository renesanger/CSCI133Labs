* Additional instructions for Lab 7

* Changes from the lab description
** void writeImage(string fname,int image[][MAXHEIGHT], int width, int height);
In the lab description, *writeImage* only asks for the int array
(image), width, and height. 

Our version also asks for a filename as the first parameter so we can
save different output files.

* Important lab instructions
** Task 0

For this, make function with the prototype ~void task0()~. It should declare arrays as
specified in the question as local variables and it should read the
source image using *readImage*.

It should save an image named *task0.pgm* 

** Task 1

In addition to writing *highlight* as specified in the question,
also write a function ~void task1()~. 

This function should read the starter image (as in task0) and then,
instead of asking for using input, it should call highlight on the
source image and then save it. After this routine, you should have
saved images named *task1-1.pgm*, *task1-2.pgm*, and *task1-3.pgm*.


** Task 2

As described in the question, write the function but have it save the
output image under the name *task2.pgm*
