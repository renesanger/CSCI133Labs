test cases

10, 2.5, .2, 120, 20

120, 3




What i did I was I made the variable p,m,h,k into constants that are equal to a fixed value. I only changed the g value and experimented until i reached an oscilating value

my first g value was 1
then I tried 1.25,1.5,1.75

when i put 2 the numbers started to osscilate
the first number that oscilates is around 1.94 to 2

1	25

4	110

6	109
7	106
8	108
9	107
10	108
11	107

13	107
14	108
15	107
16	108
17	107
18	108
19	107
20	108

after doing this, I repeated the process to find the g value that make the numbers chaotic.
when I used 2.7 as a g value it still osscilates at a more chaotic way but still follows a pattern

compared to when i did 2.75, it starts to become chaotic and follows no pattern.
