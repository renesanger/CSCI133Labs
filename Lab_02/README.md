What i did I was I made the variable p,m,h,k into constants that are equal to a fixed value. I only changed the g value and experimented until i reached an oscilating value

My first g value was 1
then I tried 1.25,1.5,1.75

When i put 2 the numbers started to osscilate
the first number that oscilates is around 1.94 to 2

		16	108
		17	107
		18	108
		19	107
		20	108

After doing this, I repeated the process to find the g value that make the numbers chaotic.
when I used 2.7 as a g value it still osscilates at a more chaotic way but still follows a pattern

compared to when i did 2.75, it starts to become chaotic and follows no pattern.
