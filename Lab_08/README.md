i found this lab to be one of the hardere ones but not as hard as the image lab that we did on the previous one. i strugggled most on the inputting of the file which i still kind of dont understand because when i code it doesnt work and then it works and i have no idea what ive changed to make itwork.

task 1 and task 2 are relatively easy because all you have to do is compare values. and store the desired values in a variable "max or "min"
