QUESTION
Run your above program, typing in a non-numeric value at a parameter prompt. State what happens in comments. Also state what happens if you enter a number causing overflow. You may need to terminate the program. In Linux this is done by typing ^C. Alternatively, you can open another window, list all

ANSWER
-when typing a non numeric value, the program acts for another input until it gets a proper parameter input
-typing a letter or special character for example causes the program to re-enter the loop that asks for a parameter.
-when you enter a number that is too big, the program freezes it makes you wait a very long time and does nothing until you terminate the program.

-input validation made, error messages diplayed.
